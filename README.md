# **📦 \[Project Name]**

**MVP Status:** \[e.g., v1.0-Production]

**Group Members:** Yousef Abouturkia, Charlie Delecoeur, Simon berger, Camy Merdji


## **🎯 Project Overview**

Provide a concise (2-3 sentence) description of what your application does and the specific problem it solves. Why did you build this?


## **🚀 Quick Start (Architect Level: < 60s Setup)**

Instructions on how to get this project running on a fresh machine.

1. **Clone the repo:**\
   git clone \[your-repo-link]\
   cd \[project-folder]

2. **Setup Virtual Environment:**\
   python -m venv .venv\
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies:**\
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. **Run Application:**\
   python main.py


## **🛠️ Technical Architecture**

Explain how your code is organized. An "Architect-level" README should describe the separation of concerns.

- **main.py**: Entry point of the application.

- **logic/**: Contains core algorithms and data processing.

- **ui/**: Handles user interactions (CLI/GUI).

- **utils/**: Helper functions and shared constants.


## **🧪 Testing & Validation**

How can a user verify the code works?

- List any test scripts included (e.g., pytest tests/).

- Describe the "Happy Path" inputs for the demo.


## **📦 Dependencies**

List the main third-party libraries used and _why_ they were chosen:

- library\_name: \[Reason for use]
