# 📢 Team Presentation Template: The 5-Minute Pitch

# This template is designed for a **group of 2-4 students**. Distribute the speaking roles so everyone is involved.

## Slide 1: The Hook (30 Seconds)

# - **Speaker 1:** Project Name & Team Introduction.

- **The Problem:** Define the "pain point" your app solves in one sentence.

## Slide 2: The Solution & Roles (45 Seconds)

# - **Speaker 2:** "We built \[Project Name] to solve \[Problem]."

- **Team Roles:** Briefly state who was responsible for what (e.g., "Student A: Backend Logic, Student B: UI & Integration").

## Slide 3: The Live Demo (2 Minutes) 💻

# - **Speaker 3 (or Lead Dev):** Conduct the walkthrough.

- **The Happy Path:** Show the core feature working.

- **Resilience:** Show a "User Error" and how your code catches it.

- _Note: The person not speaking should be the one operating the keyboard._

## Slide 4: Engineering & Collaboration (1 Minute)

# - **Speaker 4 (or Shared):** \* **The Stack:** Libraries used.

  - **The Workflow:** "We used Git to manage our modules and merged our features into a final build."

  - **Challenge:** One specific technical hurdle the group solved together.

## Slide 5: The Future & Handover (45 Seconds)

# - **Speaker 1:** What would "Version 2.0" look like?

- **Call to Action:** "We are ready for the Technical Defense."

## 💡 Team Pitching Tips:

# 1. **The "Hand-off":** Practice saying, "Now, \[Name] will show you the demo." It makes the group look professional.

2. **Be the Backup:** If the person demoing gets stuck, another teammate should be ready to jump in and explain the logic while the issue is fixed.

3. **Stand Together:** Even when you aren't speaking, stay engaged with the presentation.
